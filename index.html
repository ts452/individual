                        Is117 taught me many features of how to design a website from understanding the basics of creating a website. I took this class as an elective and I entirely enjoyed it. From the beginning of the semester till now I can see how much I improved of how to deisgn websites. In this portfolio, I am going to provide all the projects and skills I learned in this class. Thank you.

                                <br>Push: Updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch <br>
                                <br>Pull: Updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.<br>
                                <br>Branch: Shows each section of being worked on locally.<br>
                                <br>Merge: This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the master branch for deployment.<br>
                                <br>Merge Conflict: Sometimes when you get merge conflicts when merging or pulling from a branch. It will tell you to fix it and and then commit your results.<br>
                                <br>Fetch: Related to getting, reading, or moving data objects<br>
                                <br>Remote: A user does not have physical access, but which he or she can access or manipulate via some kind of computer network.<br>

                            <p> <br>  In 1969-1970, Kenneth Thompson and others at AT&T Bell Labs began developing a small operating system PDP-7, also known as Unix <br>
                                <br> In 1972-1973 the system was rewritten in the programming language C.  <br>
                                <br> AT&T continued developing Unix under the names “System III” and later “System V". <br>
                                <br> Soon, there was many different versions of Unix.  <br>
                                <br> In 1984 Richard Stallman’s Free Software Foundation (FSF) began a project after which, the software could be freely used, read, modified, and redistributed. The FSF successfully built a vast number of useful components, including a C compiler (gcc), an impressive text editor (emacs), and a host of fundamental tools.  <br>
                                <br> In 1991 Linus Torvalds began developing an operating system, which he named “Linux” . This was known as a freely-modifiable and very useful operating system.  <br>
                                <br> This is an example of a Linux-based system: https://www.ubuntu.com/  <br>
                                <br> The LINUX system has a few commands which are listed here: Common Commands
                                Under this website, we will inform of how each component of how the internet works and how linux.
                                Many people will take the internet granted.
                                The internet has so many functions which will be listed down here. How Does the Internet Work?

                                <h1> How does the Internet work? </h1>
                            <p>In this tutorial we will talk about DNS, IP, Domain Names,Top level domain names(TLD), how to read a web address,SSL secure website browsing through HTTPS over port 443 and HTTP over port 80, REST and Roy Fielding's dissertation.</p>
                            <dl> 1. Laptop and computer is connected to the Wifi which is connected to Internet service provider (ISP) which will be able to connected to multiple networks globally.</dl>
                            <dl>a. Protocol: a well known set of rules and standards used to communicate between machines. </dl>
                            <dl>2. Every device on the internet in the world have a unique address called Internet Protocol address.</dl>
                            <dl>a. The IP address is just an a number and it it similar like a home address.</dl>
                            <dl>b.The IP address would be represented in bits. </dl>
                            <dl>c. Traditional IP address are 32 bits long with 8 bits from each part which are called IPV4.</dl>
                            <dl>d. Traditional hierarchy IP: country network, region network, subnetwork, device.</dl>
                            <dl>e. In IPV6: It is a multi year which has 128 bits which provides 340 undecillion unique address.</dl>
                            <dl>3. To visit a website one device is asking another device for information. One device will send its IP address then receive its origin address so it would easier for the devices to understand where to send their information. </dl>
                            <dl>4. Domain Name systems (DNS) associates websites name to its ip address. </dl>
                            <dl>a. For example, I will type up facebook.com and the DNS will find the correct IP address to the destination address.</dl>
                            <dl>5. You need to be careful of DNS spoofing which is when a hacker types into the DNS server and changes to match the main name with the wrong IP address and this will make you regard a fake website.</dl>
                            <dl>6. You need to be careful of DNS spoofing which is when a hacker types into the DNS server and changes to match the main name with the wrong IP address and this will make you regard a fake website.</dl>
                            <dl>7.To access the web you use a web browser by writing the url. </dl>
                            <dl>8. The computer talks to another server by communicating to each other called http. </dl>
                            <dl>9.The server will send a get request to get the website it needs to get all the html code they need. </dl>
                            <dl>a. Go to facebook.com it will go to facebook server then you will get all the html code from that website. </dl>
                            <dl>b. Images and videos are separate files with unique urls so you need to a get a get request text in order to get that html. </dl>
                            <dl>10. If the user hasl send a http post request by adding cookies. </dl>
                            <dl>a. The user will use this request when they are filling out surveys or searching something.</dl>
                            <dl>11. Cookies will be used by remeing who you are every time you use the internet.</dl>
                            <dl>a.The user will use this request when they are filling out surveys or searching </dl>
                            <dl>12. The ssl secure website prevents snooping and tampering by communicating on a secure channel by using secure sockets layer and transport layer</dl>
                            <dl>13. The secure sockets layer and transport layer is a layer of security wrapped around your communications.</dl>
                            <dl>14. There would be a lock near the https webpage which will indicate if it has a secure connection. </dl>
                            <dl>a. While searching a website with a secure connection then it provides a digital certificate.</dl>
                            <dl> b. If you searching a website without a secure connection then it will provide a janky certificate and warn you.</dl>
                            <dl>15. There are two common types of protocols which called https and http</dl>
                            <dl>a. Https is used over a secure website with port 443. Majority of the websites are under https. </dl>
